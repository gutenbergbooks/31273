<h2 class="chapterhead">THE ARAWACK LANGUAGE OF GUIANA<br />

<span class="size50per">IN ITS</span><br />

LINGUISTIC AND ETHNOLOGICAL RELATIONS.</h2>

<p class="titlepage">BY D. G. BRINTON, M. D.</p>

<hr class="decshort" />


<p>The Arawacks are a tribe of Indians who at present dwell in British and
Dutch Guiana, between the Corentyn and Pomeroon rivers. They call
themselves simply <i>lukkunu</i>, men, and only their neighbors apply to them
the contemptuous name <i>aruac</i> (corrupted by Europeans into Aroaquis,
Arawaaks, Aroacos, Arawacks, etc.), meal-eaters, from their peaceful
habit of gaining an important article of diet from the amylaceous pith
of the <i>Mauritia flexuosa</i> palm, and the edible root of the cassava
plant.</p>

<p>They number only about two thousand souls, and may seem to claim no more
attention at the hands of the ethnologist than any other obscure Indian
tribe. But if it can be shown that in former centuries they occupied the
whole of the West Indian archipelago to within a few miles of the shore
of the northern continent, then on the question whether their
affiliations are with the tribes of the northern or southern mainland,
depends our opinion of the course of migration of the primitive
inhabitants of the western world. And if this is the tribe whose
charming simplicity Columbus and Peter Martyr described in such poetic
language, then the historian will acknowledge a desire to acquaint
himself more closely with its past and its present. It is my intention
to show that such was their former geographical position.</p>

<p>While in general features there is nothing to distinguish them from the
red race elsewhere, they have strong national traits. Physically they
are rather undersized, averaging not over five feet four inches in
height, but strong-limbed, agile, and symmetrical. Their foreheads are
low, their noses more allied to the Aryan types than usual with their
race, and their skulls of that form defined by craniologists as
orthognathic brachycephalic.</p>

<p>From the earliest times they have borne an excellent character.
Hospitable, peace-loving, quick to accept the humbler arts of
civilization and the simpler precepts of Christianity, they have ever
offered a strong contrast to their neighbors, the cruel and warlike
Caribs. They are not at all prone to steal, lie, or drink, and their
worst faults are an addiction to blood-revenge, and a superstitious
veneration for their priests.</p>

<p>They are divided into a number of families, over fifty in all, the
genealogies of which are carefully kept in the female line, and the
members of any one of which are forbidden to intermarry. In this
singular institution they resemble many other native tribes.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead">LANGUAGE.</h3>

<p>The earliest specimen of their language under its present name is given
by Johannes de Laet in his <i>Novus Orbis, seu Descriptio Indiæ
Occidentalis</i> (Lugd. Bat. 1633). It was obtained in 1598. In 1738 the
Moravian brethren founded several missionary stations in the country,
but owing to various misfortunes, the last of their posts was given up
in 1808. To them we owe the only valuable monuments of the language in
existence.</p>

<p>Their first instructor was a mulatto boy, who assisted them in
translating into the Arawack a life of Christ. I cannot learn that this
is extant. Between 1748 and 1755 one of the missionaries, Theophilus
Schumann, composed a dictionary, <i>Deutsch-Arawakisches Wœrterbuch</i>,
and a grammar, <i>Deutsch-Arawakische Sprachlehre</i>, which have remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
in manuscript in the library of the Moravian community at Paramaribo.
Schumann died in 1760, and as he was the first to compose such works,
the manuscript dictionary in the possession of Bishop Wullschlägel,
erroneously referred by the late Professor von Martius to the first
decade of the last century, is no doubt a copy of Schumann’s.</p>

<p>In 1807 another missionary, C. Quandt, published a <i>Nachricht von
Surinam</i>, the appendix to which contains the best published grammatical
notice of the tongue. The author resided in Surinam from 1769 to 1780.</p>

<p>Unquestionably, however, the most complete and accurate information in
existence concerning both the verbal wealth and grammatical structure of
the language, is contained in the manuscripts of the Rev. Theodore
Schultz, now in the library of the <span class="smcap">American Philosophical Society</span>. Mr.
<a name="corr1" id="corr1"></a><ins class="correction" title="Schultz">Shultz</ins> was a Moravian missionary, who was stationed among the
Arawacks from 1790 to 1802, or thereabout. The manuscripts referred to
are a dictionary and a grammar. The former is a quarto volume of 622
pages. The first 535 pages comprise an Arawack-German lexicon, the
remainder is an appendix containing the names of trees, stars, birds,
insects, grasses, minerals, places, and tribes. The grammar,
<i>Grammattikalische Sätze von der Aruwakkischen Sprache</i>, is a 12mo
volume of 173 pages, left in an unfinished condition. Besides these he
left at his death a translation of the Acts of the Apostles, which was
published in 1850 by the American Bible Society under the title <i>Act
Apostelnu</i>. It is from these hitherto unused sources that I design to
illustrate the character of the language, and study its former
extension.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>


<h3 class="sectionhead">PHONETICS.</h3>

<p>The Arawack is described as “the softest of all the Indian tongues.”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
It is rich in vowels, and free from gutturals. The enunciation is
distinct and melodious. As it has been reduced to writing by Germans,
the German value must be given to the letters employed, a fact which
must always be borne in mind in comparing it with the neighboring
tongues, nearly all of which are written with the Spanish orthography.</p>

<p>The Arawack alphabet has twenty letters: a, b, d, e, g, h, i, j, k, l,
m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, w.</p>

<p>Besides these, they have a semi-vowel written <sup>l</sup><sub class="shiftleft">r</sub> the sound of which in
words of the masculine gender approaches l, in those of the neuter
gender r. The o and u, and the t and d, are also frequently blended. The
w has not the German but the soft English sound, as in <i>we</i>. The German
<a name="corr2" id="corr2"></a><ins class="correction" title="diphthongs">dipthongs</ins> æ, œ, eu, ei, ü, are employed. The accents are the
long ^, the acute `, and that indicating the emphasis ´. The latter is
usually placed near the commencement of the word, and must be carefully
observed.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead">NOUNS.</h3>

<p>Like most Indians, the Arawack rarely uses a noun in the abstract. An
object in his mind is always connected with some person or thing, and
this connection is signified by an affix, a suffix, or some change in
the original form of the word. To this rule there are some exceptions,
as <i>bahü</i> a house, <i>siba</i> a stone, <i>hiäru</i> a woman. <i>Dáddikân hiäru</i>, I
see a woman. Such nouns are usually roots. Those derived from verbal
roots are still more rarely employed independently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Numbers.</span> The plural has no regular termination. Often the same form
serves for both numbers, as is the case in many English words. Thus,
<i>itime</i> fish and fishes, <i>siba</i> stone and stones, <i>känsiti</i> a lover and
lovers. The most common plural endings are <i>ati</i>, <i>uti</i>, and <i>anu</i>,
connected to the root by a euphonic letter; as <i>uju</i> mother, <i>ujunuti</i>
mothers, <i>itti</i> father, <i>ittinati</i> fathers, <i>kansissia</i> a loved one,
<i>kansissiannu</i> loved ones.</p>

<p>Of a dual there is no trace, nor does there seem to be of what is called
the American plural (exclusive or inclusive of those present). But there
is a peculiar plural form with a singular signification in the language,
which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> worthy of note. An example will illustrate it; <i>itti</i> is
father, plural <i>ittinati</i>; <i>wattinati</i> is our father, not our fathers,
as the form would seem to signify. In other words, singular nouns used
with plural pronouns, or construed with several other nouns, take a
plural form. <i>Petrus Johannes mutti ujúnatu</i>, the mother of Peter and
John.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Genders.</span> A peculiarity, which the Arawack shares with the Iroquois<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
and other aboriginal languages of the Western continent, is that it only
has two genders, and these not the masculine and feminine, as in French,
but the masculine and neuter. Man or nothing was the motto of these
barbarians. Regarded as an index of their mental and social condition,
this is an ominous fact. It hints how utterly destitute they are of
those high, chivalric feelings, which with us centre around woman.</p>

<p>The termination of the masculine is <i>i</i>, of the neuter <i>u</i>, and, as I
have already observed, a permutation of the semi-vowels <i>l</i> and <i>r</i>
takes place, the letter becoming <i>l</i> in the masculine, <i>r</i> in the
neuter. A slight difference in many words is noticeable when pronounced
by women or by men. The former would say <i>keretin</i>, to marry; the latter
<i>kerejun</i>. The gender also appears by more than one of these changes:
<i>ipillin</i>, great, strong, masculine; <i>ipirrun</i>, feminine and neuter.</p>

<p>There is no article, either definite or indefinite, and no declension of
nouns.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead">PRONOUNS.</h3>

<p>The demonstrative and possessive personal pronouns are alike in form,
and, as in other American languages, are intimately incorporated with
the words with which they are construed. A single letter is the root of
each: <i>d</i> I, mine, <i>b</i> thou, thine, <i>l</i> he, his, <i>t</i> she, her, it, its,
<i>w</i> we, our, <i>h</i> you, your, <i>n</i> they, their; to these radical letters
the indefinite pronoun <i>ükküahü</i>, somebody, is added, and by
abbreviation the following forms are obtained, which are those usually
current:</p>

<table class="grammar" summary="examples">
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">dakia, dai,</td>
  <td>I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">bokkia, bui,</td>
  <td>thou.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">likia,</td>
  <td>he.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">turreha,</td>
  <td>she, it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">wakia, wai,</td>
  <td>we.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">hukia, hui,</td>
  <td>you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">nakia, nai,</td>
  <td>they.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">Except the third person, singular, they are of both genders. In
speaking, the abbreviated form is used, except where for emphasis the
longer is chosen.</p>

<p>In composition they usually retain their first vowel, but this is
entirely a question of euphony. The methods of their employment with
nouns will be seen in the following examples:</p>

<table class="grammar" summary="examples">
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft"><i>üssiquahü</i>,</td>
  <td>a house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">dássiqua,</td>
  <td>my house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">bússiqua,</td>
  <td>thy house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">lüssiqua,</td>
  <td>his house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">tüssiqua,</td>
  <td>her, its house.</td>

  <td class="gramleft">wássiqua,</td>
  <td>our house.</td>

<tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>

  <td>your house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">nássiqua,</td>
  <td>their house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft"><i>uju</i>,</td>
  <td>mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">daiju,</td>
  <td>my mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>buju,</td>
  <td>thy mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">luju,</td>
  <td>his mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">tuju,</td>
  <td>her mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">waijunattu,</td>
  <td>our mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">hujuattu,</td>
  <td>your mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">naijattu,</td>
  <td>their mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">waijunuti,</td>
  <td>our mothers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">hujunuti,</td>
  <td>your mothers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">naijunuti,</td>
  <td>their mothers.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Many of these forms suffer elision in speaking. <i>Itti</i> father, <i>datti</i>
my father, <i>wattínatti</i> our father, contracted to <i>wattínti</i> (<i>watti</i>
rarely used).</p>

<p>When thus construed with pronouns, most nouns undergo some change of
form, usually by adding an affix; <i>báru</i> an axe, <i>dábarun</i> my axe,
<i>iulí</i> tobacco, <i>dajulite</i> my tobacco.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead">ADJECTIVES.</h3>

<p>The verb is the primitive part of speech in American tongues. To the
aboriginal man every person and object presents itself as either doing
or suffering something, every quality and attribute as something which
is taking place or existing. His philosophy is that of the extreme
idealists or the extreme materialists, who alike maintain that nothing
<i>is</i>, beyond the cognizance of our senses. Therefore his adjectives are
all verbal participles, indicating a state of existence. Thus <i>üssatu</i>
good, is from <i>üssân</i> to be good, and means the condition of being good,
a good woman or thing, <i>üssati</i> a good man.</p>

<p>Some adjectives, principally those from present participles, have the
masculine and neuter terminations <i>i</i> and <i>u</i> in the singular, and in
the plural <i>i</i> for both genders. Adjectives from the past participles
end in the singular in <i>issia</i> or <i>üssia</i>, in the plural in <i>annu</i>. When
the masculine ends in <i>illi</i>, the neuter takes <i>urru</i>, as <i>wadikilli</i>,
<i>wadikurru</i>, long.</p>

<p>Comparison is expressed by adding <i>bén</i> or <i>kén</i> or <i>adin</i> (a verb
meaning to be above) for the comparative, and <i>apüdi</i> for the
diminutive. <i>Ubura</i>, from the verb <i>uburau</i> to be before in time, and
<i>adiki</i>, from <i>adikin</i> to be after in time, are also used for the same
purpose. The superlative has to be expressed by a circumlocution; as
<i>tumaqua aditu ipirrun turreha</i>, what is great beyond all else;
<i>bokkia üssá dáuria</i>, thou art better than I, where the last word is a
compound of <i>dai uwúria</i> of, from, than. The comparative degree of the
adjectives corresponds to the intensive and frequentative forms of the
verbs; thus <i>ipirrun</i> to be strong, <i>ipirru</i> strong, <i>ipirrubîn</i> and
<i>ipirrubessabun</i> to be stronger, <i>ipirrubetu</i> and <i>ipirrubessabutu</i>
stronger, that which is stronger.</p>

<p>The numerals are wonderfully simple, and well illustrate how the
primitive man began his arithmetic. They are:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="ix">
  <li>1 abba.</li>
  <li>2 biama, plural biamannu.</li>
  <li>3 kabbuhin, plural kubbuhinínnu.</li>
  <li>4 bibiti, plural bibitinu.</li>
  <li>5 abbatekkábe, plural abbatekabbunu.</li>
  <li>6 abbatiman, plural abbatimannínu.</li>
  <li>7 biamattiman, plural biamattimannínu.</li>
  <li>8 kabbuhintiman, plural kabbuhintimannínu.</li>
  <li>9 bibitiman, plural bibititumannínu.</li>
  <li>10 biamantekábbe, plural biamantekábunu.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now if we analyze these words, we discover that <i>abbatekkábe</i> five, is
simply <i>abba</i> one, and <i>akkabu</i>, hand; that the word for six is
literally “one [finger] of the other [hand],” for seven “two [fingers]
of the other [hand],” and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> on to ten, which is compounded of <i>biama</i>
two, and <i>akkabu</i> hands. Would they count eleven, they say <i>abba
kutihibena</i> one [toe] from the feet, and for twenty the expression is
<i>abba lukku</i> one man, both hands and feet. Thus, in truth, they have
only four numerals, and it is even a question whether these are
primitive, for <i>kabbuhin</i> seems a strengthened form of <i>abba</i>, and
<i>bibuti</i> to bear the same relation to <i>biama</i>. Therefore we may look
back to a time when this nation knew not how to express any numbers
beyond one and two.</p>

<p>Although these numbers do not take peculiar terminations when applied to
different objects, as in the languages of Central America and Mexico,
they have a great variety of forms to express the relationship in which
they are used. The ordinals are:</p>

<table class="grammar" summary="examples">
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">atenennuati,</td>
  <td>first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">ibiamattéti,</td>
  <td>second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">wakábbuhinteti,</td>
  <td>our third, etc.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">To the question, How many at a time? the answer is:</p>

<table class="grammar" summary="examples">
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">likinnekewai,</td>
  <td>one alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">biamanuman,</td>
  <td>two at a time, etc.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">If simply, How many? it is:</p>

<table class="grammar" summary="examples">
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">abbahu,</td>
  <td>one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">biamahu,</td>
  <td>two.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">If, For which time? it is:</p>

<table class="grammar" summary="examples">
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">tibíakuja,</td>
  <td>for the first time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">tibíamattétu,</td>
  <td>for the second time.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">and so on.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead">VERBS.</h3>

<p>The verbs are sometimes derived from nouns, sometimes from participles,
sometimes from other verbs, and have reflexive, passive, frequentative,
and other forms. Thus from <i>lana</i>, the name of a certain black dye,
comes <i>lannatün</i> to color with this dye, <i>alannatunna</i> to color oneself
with it, <i>alannattukuttun</i> to let oneself be colored with it,
<i>alanattukuttunnua</i> to be colored with it.</p>

<p>The infinitive ends in <i>in</i>, <i>ün</i>, <i>ùn</i>, <i>ân</i>, <i>unnua</i>, <i>ên</i>, and <i>ûn</i>.
Those in <i>in</i>, <i>ün</i>, <i>ùn</i>, and <i>ân</i> are transitive, in <i>unnua</i> are
passive and neuter, the others are transitive, intransitive, or neuter.</p>

<p>The passive voice is formed by the medium of a verb of permission, thus:</p>

<table class="grammar" summary="examples">
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">amalitin,</td>
  <td>to make.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">amalitikittin,</td>
  <td>to let make.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">amalitikittunnua,</td>
  <td>to be made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">assimakin,</td>
  <td>to call.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">assimakuttün,</td>
  <td>to let call,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">assimakuttùnnua,</td>
  <td>to be called.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The personal pronouns are united to the verbs as they are to the nouns.
They precede all verbs except those whose infinitives terminate in <i>ên</i>,
<i>in</i>, and <i>ân</i>, to which they are suffixed as a rule, but not always.
When they follow the verb, the forms of the pronouns are either <i>de</i>,
<i>bu</i>, <i>i</i> he, <i>n</i> she, it, <i>u</i>, <i>hu</i>, <i>je</i> or <i>da</i>, <i>ba</i>, <i>la</i>, <i>ta</i>,
<i>wa</i>, <i>ha</i>, <i>na</i>. The latter are used chiefly where the negative prefix
<i>m</i>, <i>ma</i> or <i>maya</i> is employed. Examples:</p>

<p class="gramcenter">hallikebben, to rejoice.</p>

<table class="grammar" summary="examples">
<tr>
  <td class="gramleft">hallikebbéde,</td>
  <td>I rejoice.</td>

<h3 class="sectionhead">COMPOSITION OF WORDS AND SENTENCES.</h3>

<p>“In general,” remarks Prof. Von Martius, “this language betrays the
poverty and cumbrousness of other South American languages; yet in many
expressions a glimpse is caught of a far reaching, ideal background.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
We see it in the composition and derivation of some words; from <i>haikan</i>
to pass by, comes <i>haikahu</i> death, the passing away, and <i>aiihakü</i>
marriage, in which, as in death, the girl is lost to her parents; from
<i>kassan</i> to be pregnant, comes <i>kassaku</i> the firmament, big with all
things which are, and <i>kassahu behü</i>, the house of the firmament, the
sky, the day; from <i>ükkü</i> the heart, comes <i>ükkürahü</i> the family, the
tribe, those of one blood, whose hearts beat in unison, and <i>üküahü</i> a
person, one whose heart beats and who therefore lives, and also,
singularly enough, <i>ükkürahü</i> pus, no doubt from that strange analogy
which in so many other aboriginal languages and myths identified the
product of suppuration with the <i>semen masculinum</i>, the physiological
germ of life.</p>

<p>The syntax of the language is not clearly set forth by any authorities.
Adjectives generally, but not always, follow the words they qualify, and
prepositions are usually placed after the noun, and often at the end of
a sentence; thus, <i>peru</i> (Spanish <i>perro</i>) <i>assimakaku naha à</i>, the dog
barks her at. To display more fully the character of the tongue, I shall
quote and analyze a verse from the <i>Act Apostelnu</i>, the 11th verse of
the 14th chapter, which in the English Protestant version reads:</p>

<p>And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices,
saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the
likeness of men.</p>

<p>In Arawack it is:</p>

<p>Addikitti uijuhu Paulus anissiäbiru, kakannaküku na assimakâka hürküren
Lÿcaonia adiân ullukku hiddin: Amallitakoananutti lukkunu dia na buté
wakkarruhu, nattukuda aijumüneria wibiti hinna.</p>

<p>Literally:</p>

<p>They&mdash;seeing (<i>addin</i> to see, gerund) the&mdash;people Paulus what&mdash;had been
done (<i>anin</i> to do, <i>anissia</i> to have been done), loudly they called
altogether the&mdash;Lycaonia speech in, thus, The&mdash;gods (present participle
of <i>amallitin</i> to make; the same appellation which the ancient Greeks
gave to poets, [Greek: poiêtai] makers, the Arawacks applied to the
divine powers) men like, us to now (<i>buté</i> nota præsentis)
are&mdash;come&mdash;down from&mdash;above&mdash;down&mdash;here ourselves because&mdash;of.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead">AFFILIATIONS OF THE ARAWACK.</h3>

<p>The Arawacks are essentially of South American origin and affiliations.
The earliest explorers of the mainland report them as living on the
rivers of Guiana, and having settlements even south of the Equator.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
De Laet in his map of Guiana locates a large tribe of “Arowaceas” three
degrees south of the line, on the right bank of the Amazon. Dr. Spix
during his travels in Brazil met with fixed villages of them near
Fonteboa, on the river Solimoes and near Tabatinga and Castro
d’Avelaes.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> They extended westward beyond the mouth of the Orinoco,
and we even hear of them in the province of Santa Marta, in the
mountains south of Lake Maracaybo.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>While their language has great verbal differences from the Tupi of
Brazil and the Carib, it has also many verbal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> similarities with both.
“The Arawack and the Tupi,” observes Professor Von Martius, “are alike
in their syntax, in their use of the possessive and personal pronouns,
and in their frequent adverbial construction;”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> and in a letter
written me shortly before his death, he remarks, in speaking of the
similarity of these three tongues: “Ich bin überzeugt dass diese [die
Cariben] eine Elite der Tupis waren, welche erst spät auf die Antillen
gekommen sind, wo die alte Tupi&mdash;Sprache in kaum erkennbaren Resten
übrig war, als man sie dort aufzeichnete.” I take pleasure in bringing
forward this opinion of the great naturalist, not only because it is not
expressed so clearly in any of his published writings, but because his
authority on this question is of the greatest weight, and because it
supports the view which I have elsewhere advanced of the migrations of
the Arawack and Carib tribes.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> These “hardly recognizable remains of
the Tupi tongue,” we shall see belonged also to the ancient Arawack at
an epoch when it was less divergent than it now is from its primitive
form. While these South American affinities are obvious, no relationship
whatever, either verbal or syntactical, exists between the Arawack and
the Maya of Yucatan, or the Chahta-Mvskoki of Florida and the northern
shore of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>As it is thus rendered extremely probable that the Arawack is closely
connected with the great linguistic families of South America, it
becomes of prime importance to trace its extension northward, and to
determine if it is in any way affined to the tongues spoken on the West
India Islands, when these were first discovered.</p>

<p>The Arawacks of to-day when asked concerning their origin point to the
north, and claim at some not very remote time to have lived at <i>Kairi</i>,
an island, by which generic name they mean Trinidad. This tradition is
in a measure proved correct by the narrative of Sir Walter Raleigh, who
found them living there in 1595,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> and by the Belgian explorers who in
1598 collected a short vocabulary of their tongue. This oldest monument
of the language has sufficient interest to deserve copying and comparing
with the modern dialect. It is as follows:</p>

<p>The syllables <i>wa</i> our, and <i>da</i> my, prefixed to the parts of the human
body, will readily be recognized. When it is remembered that the dialect
of Trinidad no doubt differed slightly from that on the mainland; that
the modern orthography is German and that of De <a name="corr4" id="corr4"></a><ins class="correction" title="Laet’s">Lact’s</ins> list is
Dutch; and that two centuries intervened between the first and second,
it is really a matter of surprise to discover such a close similarity.
Father and mother, the only two words which are not identical, are
doubtless different expressions, relationship in this, as in most native
tongues, being indicated with excessive minuteness.</p>

<p>The chain of islands which extend from Trinidad to Porto Rico were
called, from their inhabitants, the Caribby islands. The Caribs,
however, made no pretence to have occupied them for any great length of
time. They dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>tinctly remembered that a generation or two back they had
reached them from the mainland, and had found them occupied by a
peaceful race, whom they styled <i>Ineri</i> or <i>Igneri</i>. The males of this
race they slew or drove into the interior, but the women they seized for
their own use. Hence arose a marked difference between the languages of
the island Caribs and their women. The fragments of the language of the
latter show clearly that they were of Arawack lineage, and that the
so-called Igneri were members of that nation. It of course became more
or less corrupted by the introduction of Carib words and forms, so that
in 1674 the missionary De la Borde wrote, that “although there is some
difference between the dialects of the men and women, they readily
understand each other;”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and Father Breton in his Carib Grammar
(1665) gives the same forms for the declensions and conjugations of
both.</p>

<p>As the traces of the “island Arawack,” as the tongue of the Igneri may
be called, prove the extension of this tribe over all the Lesser
Antilles, it now remains to inquire whether they had pushed their
conquests still further, and had possessed themselves of the Great
Antilles, the Bahama islands, and any part of the adjacent coasts of
Yucatan or Florida.</p>

<p>All ancient writers agree that on the Bahamas and Cuba the same speech
prevailed, except Gomara, who avers that on the Bahamas “great diversity
of language” was found.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> But as Gomara wrote nearly half a century
after those islands were depopulated, and has exposed himself to just
censure for carelessness in his statements regarding the natives,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
his expression has no weight. Columbus repeatedly states that all the
islands had one language though differing, more or less, in words. The
natives he took with him from San Salvador understood the dialects in
both Cuba and Haiti. One of them on his second voyage served him as an
interpreter on the southern shore of Cuba.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>In Haiti, there was a tongue current all over the island, called by the
Spaniards <i>la lengua universal</i> and <i>la lengua cortesana</i>. This is
distinctly said by all the historians to have been but very slightly
different from that of Cuba, a mere dialectic variation in accent being
observed.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Many fragments of this tongue are preserved in the
narratives of the early explorers, and it has been the theme for some
strange and wild theorizing among would-be philologists. Rafinesque
christened it the “Taino” language, and discovered it to be closely akin
to the “Pelasgic” of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> The Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg will
have it allied to the Maya, the old Norse or Scandinavian, the ancient
Coptic, and what not. Rafinesque and Jegor von Sivors<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> have made
vocabularies of it, but the former in so uncritical, and the latter in
so superficial a manner, that they are worse than useless.</p>

<p>Although it is said there were in Haiti two other tongues in the small
contiguous provinces of Macorix de arriba and Macorix de abajo, entirely
dissimilar from the <i>lengua universal</i> and from each other, we are
justified in assuming that the prevalent tongue throughout the whole of
the Great Antilles and the Bahamas, was that most common in Haiti. I
have, therefore, perused with care all the early authorities who throw
any light upon the construction and vocabulary of this language, and
gathered from their pages the scattered information they contain. The
most valuable of these authorities are Peter Martyr de Angleria, who
speaks from conversations with natives brought to Spain by Columbus, on
his first voyage,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> and who was himself, a fine linguist, and
Bartolomé de las Casas. The latter came as a missionary to Haiti, a few
years after its discovery, was earnestly interested in the natives, and
to some extent acquainted with their language. Besides a few printed
works of small importance, Las Casas left two large and valuable works
in manuscript, the <i>Historia General de las Indias Occidentales</i>, and
the <i>Historia Apologetica de las Indias Occidentals</i>. A copy of these,
each in four large folio volumes, exists in the Library of Congress,
where I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> consulted them. They contain a vast amount of information
relating to the aborigines, especially the <i>Historia Apologetica</i>,
though much of the author’s space is occupied with frivolous discussions
and idle comparisons.</p>

<p>In later times, the scholar who has most carefully examined the relics
of this ancient tongue, is Señor Don Estevan Richardo, a native of
Haiti, but who for many years resided in Cuba. His views are contained
in the preface to his <i>Diccionario Provincial casi-razonado de Voces
Cubanas</i>, (Habana, 2da ed, 1849). He has found very many words of the
ancient language retained in the provincial Spanish of the island, but
of course in a corrupt form. In the vocabulary which I have prepared for
the purpose of comparison, I have omitted all such corrupted forms, and
nearly all names of plants and animals, as it is impossible to identify
these with certainty, and in order to obtain greater accuracy, have
used, when possible, the first edition of the authors quoted, and in
most instances, given under each word a reference to some original
authority.</p>

<p>From the various sources which I have examined, the alphabet of the
<i>lengua universal</i> appears to have been as follows: a, b, d, e, (rarely
used at the commencement of a word), g, j, (an aspirated guttural like
the Catalan j, or as Peter Martyr says, like the Arabic ch), i (rare), l
(rare), m, n, o (rare,) p, q, r, s, t, u, y. These letters, it will be
remembered, are as in Spanish.</p>

<p>The Spanish sounds z, ce, ci (English th,) ll, and v, were entirely
unknown to the natives, and where they appear in indigenous words, were
falsely written for l and b. The Spaniards also frequently distorted the
native names by writing x for j, s, and z, by giving j the sound of the
Latin y, and by confounding h, j, and f, as the old writers frequently
employ the h to designate the <i>spiritus asper</i>, whereas in modern
Spanish it is mute.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>Peter Martyr found that he could reduce all the words of their language
to writing, by means of the Latin letters without difficulty, except in
the single instance of the guttural j. He, and all others who heard it
spoken, describe it as “soft and not less liquid than the Latin,” “rich
in vowels and pleasant to the ear,” an idiom “simple, sweet, and
sonorous.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

retain it. The modern Cubans pronounce it like the English w with the

is not an article, but corresponds to the <i>ah</i> in the Maya, and the

be accidental. Father Ximenes, who translated the <i>Livre Sacrè</i>, derives
the name from the Quiché <i>hu rakan</i>, one foot. Father Thomas Coto, in
his Cakchiquel Dictionary, (MS. in the library of the Am. Phil. Soc.)
translates <i>diablo</i> by <i>hurakan</i>, but as the equivalent of the Spanish

<p>Maisi, maize. From this Eng. <i>maize</i>, Sp. <i>mais</i>, Ar. <i>marisi</i>, maize.</p>

Las Casas, Hist. Apol. <a name="corr10" id="corr10"></a><ins class="correction" title="cap.">cap,</ins> 197); <i>tayno</i> vir bonus, <i>taynos</i>
nobiles, says Pet. Martyr, (Decad. p. 25). The latter truncated form of
the word was adopted by Rafinesque and others, as a general name for the
people and language of Hayti. There is not the slightest authority for
this, nor for supposing, with Von Martius, that the first syllable is a
pronominal prefix. The derivation is undoubtedly Ar. <i>nüddan</i> to look
well, to stand firm, to do anything well or skilfully.</p>

<p>Nucay or nozay, gold, used especially in Cuba and on the Bahamas. The
words <i>caona</i> and <i>tuob</i> were in vogue in Haiti (Navarrete, Viages, Tom.
1, pp. 45, 134).</p>

<p>Operito, dead, and</p>

<p>Opia, the spirit of the dead (Pane, pp. 443, 444). Ar. <i>aparrün</i> to
kill, <i>apparahun</i> dead, <i>lupparrükittoa</i> he is dead.</p>

<p>Quisquéia, a native name of Haiti; “vastitas et universus ac totus. Uti
Græci suum Panem,” says Pet. Martyr (Decad. p. 279). “Madre de las
tierras,” Valverde translates it (<i>Idea del valor de la Isla Espanola</i>,
Introd. p. xviii). The orthography is evidently very false.</p>

<p>Sabana, a plain covered with grass without trees (terrano llano, Oviedo,
Hist. Gen. lib. vi. cap. 8). From this the Sp. <i>savana</i>, Eng.
<i>savannah</i>. Charlevoix, on the authority of Mariana, says it is an
ancient Gothic word (Histoire de l’Isle St. Domingue, i. p. 53). But it
is probably from the Ar. <i>sallaban</i>, smooth, level.</p>

<p>Semi, the divinities worshipped by the natives (“Lo mismo que nosotros
llamamos Diablo,” Oviedo, Hist. Gen. lib. v. cap. 1. Not evil spirits
only, but all spirits). Ar. <i>semeti</i> sorcerers, diviners, priests.</p>

<p>Siba, a stone. Ar. <i>siba</i>, a stone.</p>

<p>Starei, shining, glowing (relucens, Pet. Martyr, Decad. p. 304). Ar.
<i>terén</i> to be hot, glowing, <i>terehü</i> heat.</p>

<p>Tabaco, the pipe used in smoking the cohoba. This word has been applied
in all European languages to the plant nicotiana tabacum itself.</p>

<p>Taita, father (Richardo). Ar. <i>itta</i> father, <i>daitta</i> or <i>datti</i> my
father.</p>

<p>Taguáguas, ornaments for the ears hammered from native gold (Las Casas,
Hist. Apol. cap. 199).</p>

<p>Tuob, gold, probably akin to <i>hobin</i>, q. v.</p>

<p>Turey, heaven. Idols were called “cosas de <i>turey</i>” (Navarrete, Viages,
Tom. i. p. 221). Probably akin to <i>starei</i>, q. v.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>The following numerals are given by Las Casas (Hist. Apol. cap. 204).</p>

<p>1 hequeti. Ar. <i>hürketai</i>, that is one, from <i>hürkün</i> to be single or
alone.</p>

<p>2 yamosa. Ar. <i>biama</i>, two.</p>

<p>3 canocum. Ar. <i>kannikún</i>, many, a large number, <i>kannikukade</i>, he has
many things.</p>

<p>4 yamoncobre, evidently formed from yamosa, as Ar. <i>bibiti</i>, four, from
<i>biama</i>, two.</p>

<p>The other numerals Las Casas had unfortunately forgotten, but he says
they counted by hands and feet, just as the Arawacks do to this day.</p>

<p>Various compound words and phrases are found in different writers, some
of which are readily explained from the Arawack. Thus <i>tureigua hobin</i>,
which Peter Martyr translates “rex resplendens uti orichalcum,”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> in
Arawack means “shining like something red.” Oviedo says that at
marriages in Cuba it was customary for the bride to bestow her favors on
every man present of equal rank with her husband before the latter’s
turn came. When all had thus enjoyed her, she ran through the crowd of
guests shouting <i>manícato, manícato</i>, “lauding herself, meaning that she
was strong, and brave, and equal to much.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> This is evidently the Ar.
<i>manikade</i>, from <i>mân</i>, <i>manin</i>, and means I am unhurt, I am
unconquered. When the natives of Haiti were angry, says Las Casas,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
they would not strike each other, but apply such harmless epithets as
<i>buticaco</i>, you are blue-eyed (anda para zarco de los ojos),
<i>xeyticaco</i>, you are black-eyed (anda para negro de los ojos), or
<i>mahite</i>, you have lost a tooth, as the case might be. The termination
<i>aco</i> in the first two of these expressions is clearly the Ar. <i>acou</i>,
or <i>akusi</i>, eyes, and the last mentioned is not unlike the Ar.
<i>márikata</i>, you have no teeth (<i>ma</i> negative, <i>ari</i> tooth). The same
writer gives for “I do not know,” the word <i>ita</i>, in Ar. <i>daitta</i>.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>Some of the words and phrases I have been unable to identify in the
Arawack. They are <i>duiheyniquen</i>, dives fluvius, <i>maguacochíos</i> vestiti
homines, both in Peter Martyr, and the following conversation, which he
says took place between one of the Haitian <a name="corr11" id="corr11"></a><ins class="correction" title="chieftains">chieftians</ins> and his
wife.</p>

<p>She. Teítoca teítoca. Técheta cynáto guamechyna. Guaibbá.</p>

<p>He. Cynáto machabuca guamechyna.</p>

<p>These words he translated: <i>teitoca</i> be quiet, <i>técheta</i> much, <i>cynato</i>
angry, <i>guamechyna</i> the Lord, <i>guaibba</i> go, <i>machabuca</i> what is it to
me. But they are either very incorrectly spelled, or are not Arawack.</p>

<p>The proper names of localities in Cuba, Hayti and the Bahamas, furnish
additional evidence that their original inhabitants were Arawacks.
Hayti, I have already shown has now the same meaning in Arawack which
Peter Martyr ascribed to it at the discovery. Cubanacan, a province in
the interior of Cuba, is compounded of <i>kuba</i> and <i>annakan</i>, in the
center;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> Baracoa, the name of province on the coast, is from Ar.
<i>bara</i> sea, <i>koan</i> to be there, “the sea is there;” in Barajagua the
<i>bara</i> again appears; Guaymaya is Ar. <i>waya</i> clay, <i>mara</i> there is none;
Marien is from Ar. <i>maran</i> to be small or poor; Guaniguanico, a province
on the narrow western extremity of the island, with the sea on either
side, is probably Ar. <i>wuini wuini koa</i>, water, water is there. The
names of tribes such as Siboneyes, Guantaneyes, owe their termination to
the island Arawack, <i>eyeri</i> men, in the modern dialect <i>hiaeru</i>,
captives, slaves. The Siboneyes are said by Las Casas, to have been the
original inhabitants of Cuba.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> The name is evidently from Ar. <i>siba</i>,
rock, <i>eyeri</i> men, “men of the rocks.” The rocky shores of Cuba gave
them this appellation. On the other hand the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> natives of the islets of
the Bahamas were called <i>lukku kairi</i>, abbreviated to <i>lukkairi</i>, and
<i>lucayos</i>, from <i>lukku</i>, man, <i>kairi</i> an island, “men of the islands;”
and the archipelago itself was called by the first explorers “las islas
de los Lucayos,” “isole delle Lucaí.”<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> The province in the western
angle of Haiti was styled Guacaiarima, which Peter Martyr translates
“insulae podex;” dropping the article, <i>caiarima</i> is sufficiently like
the Ar. <i>kairuina</i>, which signifies <i>podex</i>, Sp. <i>culata</i>, and is used
geographically in the same manner as the latter word.</p>

<p>The word Maya frequently found in the names of places in Cuba and Haiti,
as Mayaba, Mayanabo, Mayajigua, Cajimaya, Jaimayabon, is doubtless the
Ar. negative <i>ma</i>, <i>mân</i>, <i>mara</i>. Some writers have thought it
indicative of the extension of the Maya language of Yucatan over the
Antilles. Prichard, Squier, Waitz, Brasseur de Bourbourg, Bastian and
other ethnologists have felt no hesitation in assigning a large portion
of Cuba and Haiti to the Mayas. It is true the first explorers heard in
Cuba and Jamaica, vague rumors of the Yucatecan peninsula, and found wax
and other products brought from there.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> This shows that there was
some communication between the two races, but all authorities agree that
there was but one language over the whole of Cuba. The expressions which
would lead to a different opinion are found in Peter Martyr. He relates
that in one place on the southern shore of Cuba, the interpreter whom
Columbus had with him, a native of San Salvador, was at fault. But the
account of the occurrence given by Las Casas, indicates that the native
with whom the interpreter tried to converse simply refused to talk at
all.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> Again, in Martyr’s account of Grijalva’s voyage to Yucatan in
1517, he relates that this captain took with him a native to serve as an
interpreter; and to explain how this could be, he adds that this
interpreter was one of the Cuban natives “quorum idioma, si non idem,
consanguineum tamen,” to that of Yucatan. This is a mere fabrication, as
the chaplain of Grijalva on this expedition states explicitly in the
narrative of it which he wrote, that the interpreter was a native of
Yucatan, who had been captured a year before.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>Not only is there a very great dissimilarity in sound, words, and
structure, between the Arawack and Maya, but the nations were also far
asunder in culture. The Mayas were the most civilized on the continent,
while the Arawacks possessed little besides the most primitive arts, and
precisely that tribe which lived on the extremity of Cuba nearest
Yucatan, the Guanataneyes, were the most barbarous on the island.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33" href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>The natives of the greater Antilles and Bahamas differed little in
culture. They cultivated maize, manioc, yams, potatoes, corn, and
cotton. The latter they wove into what scanty apparel they required.
Their arms were bows with reed arrows, pointed with fish teeth or
stones, stone axes, spears, and a war club armed with sharp stones
called a <i>macana</i>. They were a simple hearted, peaceful, contented race,
“all of one language and all friends,” says Columbus; “not given to
wandering, naked, and satisfied with little,” says Peter Martyr; “a
people very poor in all things,” says Las Casas.</p>

<p>Yet they had some arts. Statues and masks in wood and stone were found,
some of them in the opinion of Bishop Las Casas, “very skilfully
carved.” They hammered the native gold into ornaments, and their rude
sculptures on the face of the rocks are still visible in parts of Cuba
and Haiti. Their boats were formed of single trunks of trees often of
large size, and they managed them adroitly; their houses were of reeds
covered with palm leaves, and usually accommodated a large number of
families; and in their holy places, they set up rows of large stones
like the ancient cromlechs, one of which is still preserved in Hayti,
and is known as <i>la cercada de los Indios</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>Physically they were undersized, less muscular than the Spaniards, light
in color, with thick hair and scanty beards. Their foreheads were
naturally low and retreating, and they artificially flattened the skull
by pressure on the forehead or the occiput.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>Three social grades seem to have prevailed, the common herd, the petty
chiefs who ruled villages, and the independent chiefs who governed
provinces. Of the latter there were in Cuba twenty-nine; in Haiti five,
as near as can be now ascertained.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> Some of those in Cuba had shortly
before the arrival of the Spaniards moved there from Haiti, and at the
conquest one of the principal chiefs of Haiti was a native of the
Lucayos.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>The fate of these Indians is something terrible to contemplate. At the
discovery there were probably 150,000 on Cuba, Haiti, and the
Bahamas.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> Those on the latter were carried as slaves to Haiti to work
in the mines, and all of the Lucayos exterminated in three or four years
(1508-1512).<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> The sufferings of the Haitians have been told in a
graphic manner by Las Casas in an oft-quoted work.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> His statements
have frequently been condemned as grossly exaggerated, but the official
documents of the early history of Cuba prove but too conclusively that
the worthy missionary reports correctly what terrible cruelties the
Spaniards committed. Cuba was conquered in 1514, and was then quite
densely populated. Fourteen years afterwards we find the Governor,
Gonzalo de Guzman, complaining that while troops of hunters were
formerly traversing the island constantly, asking no other pay than the
right of keeping as slaves the natives whom they captured, he now has to
pay patrolmen, as the Indians are so scarce.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> The next year (1529)
the treasurer, Lope de Hurtado, writes that the Indians are in such
despair that they are hanging themselves twenty and thirty at a
time.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> In 1530 the king is petitioned to relinquish his royalty on
the produce of the mines, because nearly all the Indians on the island
are dead.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> And in 1532 the licentiate, Vadillo, estimates the total
number of Indians on the island, including the large percentage brought
from the mainland by the slavers, at only 4,500.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43" href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>As a specimen of what the treatment of the Indians was, we have an
accusation in 1522 against Vasco Porcallo, afterwards one of the
companions of Hernando de Soto. He captured several Indians, cut off
their genitals, and forced them to eat them, cramming them down their
throats when they could not swallow. When asked for his defence,
Porcallo replied that he did it to prevent his own Indians from
committing suicide, as he had already lost two-thirds of his slaves in
that way. The defence was apparently deemed valid, for he was

<p>The myths and traditions of the Haitians have fortunately been
preserved, though not in so perfect a form as might be wished. When
Bartholomew Columbus left Rome for the Indies, he took with him a lay
brother of the order of the Hermits of St. Jerome, Ramon Pane by name, a
Catalan by birth, a worthy but credulous and ignorant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> man.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45" href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> On
reaching Haiti brother Pane was first sent among the natives of the
small province called Macorix de abajo, which had a language peculiar to
itself, but he was subsequently transferred to the province of Guarinoex
on the southeastern part of the island where the <i>lengua universal</i>
prevailed. He remained there two years, and at the request of Columbus
collected and wrote down the legends and beliefs of the natives.</p>

<p>He is not a model authority. In the first place, being a Catalan he did
not write Spanish correctly; he was very imperfectly acquainted with the
native tongue; he wrote hastily, and had not enough paper to write in
full; he is not sure that he commences their legends at the right end.
Moreover his manuscript is lost, and the only means we have of knowing
anything about it is by a very incorrectly printed Italian version,
printed in 1571, and two early synopses, one in Latin in the Decades of
Peter Martyr, the other in Italian, by Messer Zuane de Strozi of
Ferrara, which has been quite recently published for the first time.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46" href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
By comparing these we can arrive at the meaning of Brother Pane with
considerable accuracy.</p>

<p>His work contains fragments of two distinct cycles of legends, the one
describing the history of the gods, the other the history of the human
race.</p>

<p>Earliest of creatures was the woman, Atabéira or Ataves, who also bore
the other names Mamóna, Guacarapíta, Iiélla, and Guimazóa. Her son was
the supreme ruler of all things, and chiefest of divinities. His names
were Yocaúna, Guamaónocon, and Yocahu-vaguaniao-vocoti. He had a brother
called Guaca, and a son Iaiael. The latter rebelled against his father,
and was exiled for four mouths and then killed. The legend goes on to
relate that his bones were placed in a calabash and hung up in his
father’s house. Here they changed into fishes, and the calabash filled
with water. One day four brothers passed that way, who had all been born
at one time, and whose mother, Itaba tahuana, had died in bringing them
into the world. Seeing the calabash filled with fish the oldest of the
four, Caracaracol, the Scabby, lifted it down, and all commenced to eat.
While thus occupied, Yocaúna suddenly made his appearance, which so
terrified the brothers that they dropped the gourd and broke it into
pieces. From it ran all the waters of the world, and formed the oceans,
lakes, and rivers as they now are.</p>

<p>At this time there were men but no women, and the men did not dare to
venture into the sunlight. Once, as they were out in the rain, they
perceived four creatures, swift as eagles and slippery as eels. The men
called to their aid Caracaracol and his brothers, who caught these
creatures and transformed them into women. In time, these became the
mothers of mankind.</p>

<p>The earliest natives of Haiti came under the leadership of the hero-god,
Vaguoniona, a name applied by Las Casas to Yocahu, from an island to the
south called in the legend Matininó, which all the authors identify, I
know not why, with Martinique. They landed first on the banks of the
river Bahoboni in the western part of Haiti, and there erected the first
house, called Camotéia. This was ever after preserved and regarded with
respectful veneration.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, were their national myths. Conspicuously marked in them
we note the sacred number four, the four brothers typifying the cardinal
points, whose mother, the Dawn, dies in giving them birth, just as in
the Algonkin myths. These brothers aid the men in their struggles for
life, and bring to them the four women, the rain-bringing winds. Here,
too, the first of existences is the woman, whose son is at once highest
of divinities and the guide and instructor of their nation. These
peculiarities I have elsewhere shown to be general throughout the
religions of America.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47" href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>The myth of the thunder storm also appears among them in its triplicate
nature so common to the American mind. God of the storm was Guabancex,
whose statue was made of stones. When angry he sent before him as
messenger, Guatauva, to gather the winds, and accompanied by
Coatrischie, who collected the rain-clouds in the valleys of the
mountains, he swept down upon the plain, surrounded by the awful
paraphernalia of the thunder storm.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>Let us place side by side with these ancient myths the national legend
of the Arawacks.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49" href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> They tell of a supreme spiritual being Yauwahu or
Yauhahu. Pain and sickness are the invisible shafts he shoots at men,
<i>yauhahu simaira</i> the arrows of Yauhahu, and he it is whom the priests
invoke in their incantations. Once upon a time, men lived without any
means to propitiate this unseen divinity; they knew not how to ward off
his anger or conciliate him. At that time the Arawacks did not live in
Guiana, but in an island to the north. One day a man named Arawanili
walked by the waters grieving over the ignorance and suffering of his
nation. Suddenly the spirit of the waters, the woman Orehu, rose from
the waves and addressed him. She taught him the mysteries of <i>semeci</i>,
the sorcery which pleases and controls Yauhahu, and presented him with
the <i>maraka</i>, the holy calabash containing white pebbles which they
rattle during their exorcisms, and the sound of which summons the beings
of the unseen world. Arawanili faithfully instructed his people in all
that Orehu had said, and thus rescued them from their wretchedness. When
after a life of wisdom and good deeds the hour of his departure came, he
“did not die, but went up.”</p>

<p>Orehu accompanied the Arawacks when they moved to the main, and still
dwells in a treeless, desolate spot, on the banks of the Pomeroon. The
negroes of the colony have learned of her, and call her in their broken
English, the “watra-mamma,” the water-mother.</p>

<p>The proper names which occur in these myths, date back to the earliest
existence of the Arawacks as an independent tribe, and are not readily
analyzed by the language as it now exists. The Haitian Yocauna seems
indeed identical with the modern Yauhahu. Atabes or Atabéira is probably
from <i>itabo</i>, lake, lagoon, and <i>era</i>, water, (the latter only in
composition, as <i>hurruru</i>, mountain, <i>era</i>, water, mountain-water, a
spring, a source), and in some of her actions corresponds with Orehu.
Caracaracol is translated by Brother Pane, as “the Scabby” or the one
having ulcers, and in this respect the myth presents a curious analogy
with many others in America. In modern Arawack <i>karrikala</i> is a form, in
the third person singular, from <i>karrin</i>, to be sick, to be pregnant.
Arawanili, which one might be tempted to suppose gave the name Arawack
to the tribe, did not all writers derive this differently, may be a form
of <i>awawa</i>, father. In the old language, the termination <i>el</i>, is said
to have meant son.</p>

<p>Of the two remaining languages said to have been spoken in the small
provinces of Macorix de arriba and Macorix de abajo, in Hayti, we have
no certain knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50" href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> Las Casas gives one word from the former. It
is <i>bazca</i>, no, not. I cannot identify it. There is reason, however, to
suppose one of them was the Tupi or “lengua geral,” of Brazil. Pane
gives at least two words which are pure Tupi, and not Arawack. They are
the names of two hideous idols supposed to be inimical to men. The one
was Bugi, in Tupi, <i>ugly</i>, the other Aiba, in Tupi, <i>bad</i>. It is
noteworthy, also, that Pigafetta, who accompanied Magellan on his voyage
around the world, gives a number of words, ostensibly in the language of
the natives of Rio Janeiro, where the Tupi was spoken, which are
identical with those of Haiti, as <i>cacich</i>, chief, <i>boi</i>, house,
<i>hamac</i>, bed, <i>canoe</i>, boat. But Pigafetta acknowledges that he obtained
these words not from the natives themselves, but from the pilot Juan
Carvalhos, who had been for years sailing over the West Indian seas, and
had no doubt learned these words in the Antilles.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51" href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>The remaining idiom may be supposed to have been Carib, although we have
actually no evidence that the Caribs had gained a permanent foothold on
any of the Great Antilles at the period of the discovery, some careless
assertions of the old authors to the contrary, notwithstanding.</p>

<p>The investigation which I here close, shows that man in his migrations
on the Western Continent followed the lead of organic nature around him.
For it is well known that the flora and fauna of the Antilles are South
American in character, and also, that the geological structure of the
archipelago connects it with the southern mainland. So also its earliest
known human inhabitants were descended from an ancestry whose homes were
in the far south, and who by slow degrees moved from river to river,
island to island, until they came within a few miles of the northern
continent.</p>

8vo. pages 213, then one blank leaf, then 40 pages of “Anmerkungen.”
There is also a second title, in Arawack, and neither title page is
included in the pagination. The Arawack title begins: “<i>Wadaijahun
Wüüssada-goanti, Wappussida-goanti baddia Jesus Christus</i>,” etc. The
remarks at the end are chiefly grammatical and critical, and contain
many valuable hints to the student of the language. I have no doubt this
book is the Life of Christ mentioned in the text. The name of the
translator or editor is nowhere mentioned, but I have no doubt Mr.
Schultz wrote the “Anmerkungen,” and read the proof, as not only are his
grammatical signs and orthography adopted throughout, but also we know
from other sources that he was in Philadelphia at that time.</p>

correctly (not <i>Roman</i>, as all the printed authorities have it). He
described him as “hombre simple y de buena intencion;” “fuese Catalan de
nacion y no habla del todo bien nuestra lengua Castellana.” Ramon came
to Haiti four or five years before Las Casas, and the latter speaks of
him in a disparaging tone. “Este Fray Ramon escudrino lo que pudó, segun
lo que alcanzo de las lenguas que fueron tres, las que habia en esta
ysia: pero no supo sino la una de una chica provincia, que arriba
dejimos llamarse Macaria de abajo, y aquella no <a name="corr19" id="corr19"></a><ins class="correction" title="perfectamente.”">perfectamente.</ins>
(<i>Historia Apologetica, <a name="corr20" id="corr20"></a><ins class="correction" title="should be unitalicized">MSS.</ins></i> cap. 120, see also cap. 162). This
statement is not quite true, as according to Las Casas’ own admission
Pane dwelt two years in the province of Guarinoex, where the <i>lengua
universal</i> was spoken, and <i>there</i> collected these traditions.</p>

still in manuscript, I give his words. “Tres lenguas habia en esta ysla
distintas que la una a la otra no se entendia. La una era de la gente
que llamabamos Macorix de abajo y la otra de los vecinos del Macorix de
arriba. La otra lengua fue la universal de toda la tierra, y esta era
mas elegante y mas copiosa de vocablos, y mas dulce al sonido. En esto
la de Xaragua en todo llevaba ventaja, y era mui mas prima.” (<i>Historia
Apologetica</i>, cap. 197). “Es aqui de saber que un gran pedajo de esta
costa (that of the northern part of Haiti), bien mas de veinte y cinco o
treinta leguas y quince buenas y aun veinte de ancho hasta las sierras
que haren desta parte del norte la gran Vega inclusive, era poblado de
una gente que se llamaron Mazoriges, y otras Ciguayos, y tenian diversas
lenguas de la universal de todas las islas.” (<i>Historia General</i>, lib.
I, cap. 77). “Llamaban Ciguayos porque trayan todos los cabellos mui
luengos como en Nueva Castilla las mujeres,” (id. cap. 77). The cacique
of the Ciguayos was named Mayomanex or Mayobanex, (id. lib. I, cap.
120). They went almost naked, and had no arms, “eran Gallinas almenos
para con los uños, como no tuviesen armas,” (id. cap. 120.)</p>
